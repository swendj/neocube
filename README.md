# neocube

This is our "neocube"script sw_cube.py. sw_cube.py and swc.py class are based on the python port cubebit.py.

The python script works on any newer Raspberry Pi and RPi Zero 1 and 2 with the cubebit.py python port for slices based on 4tronix neopixel cubes. It is only a demo what's possible. 

swc.py is our own new class symplifing squares and cubes.
